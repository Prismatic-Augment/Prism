## Technical Details

### Encryption
```javascript
// AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2
{
  algorithm: 'AES-GCM',
  keyLength: 256,
  iterations: 100000,
  hash: 'SHA-256'
}
```

### Storage Structure
```javascript
{
  credentials: [{
    id: 'uuid',
    domain: 'https://example.com',
    username: 'visible',
    encrypted: {
      iv: [...],
      data: [...] // Contains password
    },
    lastModified: timestamp
  }],
  passwordSalt: [...],
  passwordVerifier: {...}
}
```

### API Integration
The password manager integrates with:
- Chrome Storage API (local)
- Chrome Tabs API (form detection)
- Chrome Scripting API (auto-fill)
- Chrome Notifications API (alerts)

## Troubleshooting

### Password Manager Won't Unlock
- Ensure you're using the correct master password
- Check if caps lock is on
- Try refreshing the browser

### Can't Save Passwords
- Ensure password manager is unlocked
- Check if there's already a saved credential
- Verify the form has both username and password fields

## Future Enhancements
